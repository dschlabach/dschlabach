To get to your Shopify code in order to edit your store's template, first click on _Online Store_ on the left navigation pane under _Sales Channels_.

Next, beside the purple _Customize_ button, click the _Actions_ dropdown menu.

At this point, if you aren't totally sure of what you're doing it's best to _Duplicate_ your theme in case you accidentally break something!

Once you've duplicated your theme, click _Edit Code_.

This is your Shopify theme's code!

From here, you can browse through different types of files.

## Layout Folder

The Layout folder includes your basic `theme.liquid` file - this is where the frame of your theme is held.

## Assets Folder

The Assets folder contains:

- CSS files to style your website (something like `theme.scss.liquid`)
- JavaScript files to power your store's interactivity
- Icons, fonts, and some images for your store

## Templates Folder

Template files power kinds of pages. For example, www.yourstore.com/collection/XYZ is powered by the collections template.

## Sections Folder

You can use sections on the home page while you're customizing your site from the Admin panel.

## Snippets Folder

Snippets are useful bits of code that you can plug in anywhere on your site. They're often used in Templates and Sections.
